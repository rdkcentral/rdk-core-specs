    title: Hardware Compatibility Specification
    description: Specifications that outline the minimal hardware configurations to run Core RDK
    status: Approved by RTAB for RDK9
---

This Hardware Compatibility Specification defines the minimum hardware configuration required to build, deploy, and reliably operate Core RDK on IP-based RDK-V Set-Top Boxes (STBs). It establishes baseline requirements for SoC and CPU capability, graphics, video and audio decode, content protection, system memory, flash storage, connectivity, peripherals, and power.

### Deployment Profiles

| Tier | Profile | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Tier1 | FHD | Cost-optimized 1080p Core RDK device for standard OTT services |
| Tier2 | 4K Premium | 4K UHD device supporting HDR, premium video, and enhanced application workloads |

### System Overview

The STB is a media-streaming and application host device that connects to a television through HDMI and to the home network through Wi-Fi or Ethernet. All hardware compatibility requirements defined in this specification are aligned to the Tier 1 (FHD) and Tier 2 (4K Premium) deployment profiles.

!!! note "Note"
    Requirements are expressed as capability and performance classes rather than specific vendor components. Any SoC and platform meeting the stated capabilities, driver support, and RDK HAL/API behavior qualifies. Named CPU cores, GPUs, and chipsets are provided as informative examples only.

### Hardware Compatibility Baseline Specification Matrix

!!! info "Info"
    The compatibility matrix is intended for quick platform assessment. Meeting numeric hardware minimums alone does not guarantee compatibility. A compatible platform must satisfy the required capabilities, peripherals, driver support, firmware, and RDK HAL/API behavior defined in the referenced sections.

### Appendix A - Reference Memory Measurements – Tier 1 (FHD) device

<a id="reference-memory-measurements-tier1-fhd-device"></a>

Tier 1 memory values are informative and based on historical FHD platform data. The proposed 1 GB system RAM baseline and associated application-memory targets have not yet been validated on an RDK 9 FHD configuration and therefore remain provisional under RDKDEV-1741. These values describe the expected Core RDK footprint and are provided as a starting point for OEM memory budgeting; they do not represent the complete memory requirement of a deployed operator product. OEMs and SoC vendors remain responsible for validating memory capacity, reserved-memory allocation, bandwidth, and performance on their target platforms. Validation results and any required baseline adjustments will be incorporated into a subsequent controlled revision of this specification.
